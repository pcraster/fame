Concepts
========

For detailed descriptions of concepts and implementation of the data model we refer to the publications of
de Bakker
and
de Jong.

The data model uses the follwing terminology:


Phenomenon
----------

In the conceptual data model, the concept phenomenon is used
to describe a concrete or abstract constituent of the system that is
being modelled.
A phenomenon contains one or more individuals (objects).

Domain
------
A domain is the area and time period for which a property exists,
for each object.


Property
--------
A property is a particular attribute of a phenomenon.


Property set
------------

A property set
can be thought of as a set of properties sharing a particular spatio-
temporal domain, i.e. the area and time period for which the
property exists.

Value
-----
The value allows for the modelling of spatial and temporal variation
within a domain.
